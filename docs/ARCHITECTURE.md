# Architecture

Termcmp is a terminal-native autocomplete engine that works as a PTY proxy — it sits between your terminal emulator and your shell, intercepting the data stream to render suggestion popups using native ANSI escape sequences. No Accessibility API, no IME hacks.

## Data Flow

1. User types a keystroke in the terminal emulator
2. `pty` receives it on stdin — if the popup is visible, intercept navigation keys (Tab, arrows, Escape, Enter); otherwise forward to the shell PTY
3. Shell produces output, which flows through `parser` (VT state tracking) then to terminal stdout
4. `parser` tracks cursor position, screen dimensions, prompt boundaries, CWD, and the shell's exported env snapshot using shell-emitted OSC markers
5. On trigger conditions (space after command, `/`, `-`, `--`, Ctrl+/, or delay timeout), `suggest` computes ranked suggestions
6. Static suggestions (subcommands, options, templates) render immediately via `overlay`
7. Async providers (shell completions, AI) execute in background; results merge into the popup progressively without resetting cursor position

## Crate Map

The workspace contains 9 crates under `crates/`:

| Crate | Purpose | Key Dependencies |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| [`termcmp`](../crates/termcmp/) | Binary entry point, CLI (`clap`), install/uninstall, `config`, `doctor` | clap |
| [`pty`](../crates/pty/) | PTY proxy event loop — spawns shell, multiplexes stdin/stdout with `tokio::select!`, handles SIGWINCH, async provider merge | portable-pty, tokio |
| [`parser`](../crates/parser/) | VT escape sequence parsing — cursor position, screen dimensions, prompt boundaries (OSC 133 + OSC 7771), CWD (OSC 7), exported env (OSC 7773) | vte |
| [`buffer`](../crates/buffer/) | Command line reconstruction — current command, argument position, pipes, redirects, quotes | |
| [`suggest`](../crates/suggest/) | Suggestion engine — dispatches to providers, fuzzy-ranks with frizbee | frizbee, serde_json |
| [`overlay`](../crates/overlay/) | ANSI popup rendering — cursor save/restore, synchronized output, scroll-to-make-room, scrollbar, fuzzy match highlighting | |
| [`config`](../crates/config/) | TOML config, keybindings, themes (presets + custom styles), suggestion timeouts | serde, toml |
| [`terminal`](../crates/terminal/) | Terminal detection and capability profiling — `TerminalProfile` with `RenderStrategy` and `PromptDetection` enums | |
| [`llm`](../crates/llm/) | OpenAI-compatible chat-completions client powering the AI suggestion and Ask-AI providers | reqwest, serde_json |

### Dependency Graph

```
termcmp ──► pty ──► parser
                     │    ──► buffer
                     │    ──► config
                     │    ──► terminal
                     │    ──► suggest ──► buffer
                     │                  └─► config
                     │    ──► overlay ──► suggest
                     │                  └─► terminal
```

`parser`, `buffer`, `config`, and `terminal` are leaf crates with no internal dependencies. `suggest` depends on `buffer` and `config`. `overlay` depends on `suggest` and `terminal`. `llm` depends on `suggest` and `buffer`. `pty` depends on every other crate and ties them all together.

## Key Design Decisions

### PTY Proxy over Shell Plugin

Termcmp runs as a PTY proxy rather than a zsh/fish plugin. The proxy sits between the terminal and the shell, seeing all bytes in both directions. This means:

- **No zle widget conflicts** — doesn't hook into shell internals
- **No plugin manager dependencies** — one binary, works after install
- **No RPROMPT corruption** — popup rendering is independent of shell prompt
- **Shell-agnostic core** — the same proxy works with zsh, bash, and fish

The tradeoff is complexity: we have to maintain our own VT parser to track cursor position, rather than asking the shell where it is.

### Parser-Only VT Tracking (vte)

We use the `vte` crate — a parser-only VT state machine that fires callbacks per escape sequence. We do NOT maintain a full screen buffer (like `alacritty_terminal` or `vt100`). We only track:

- Cursor position (row, column)
- Screen dimensions
- Prompt boundaries (via OSC 133 / OSC 7771)
- Current working directory (via OSC 7)
- Exported shell environment snapshot (via OSC 7773)

This keeps memory usage minimal and parsing fast. The tradeoff: cursor position can drift from reality over time (complex escape sequences we don't fully model). We correct for this using CPR sync — periodically requesting the terminal's actual cursor position via `CSI 6n` and reconciling.

### Frizbee for Fuzzy Matching

`frizbee` is the sole fuzzy matching engine. It supports two match modes — `Fuzzy` (subsequence: `gco` matches `git checkout`) and `Substring` (contiguous: `cl` matches `clone` but not `calendar`) — with smart case sensitivity. The matcher is constructed once per query via `Matcher::from_query` and applied to the full candidate list in a single `match_list_indices` pass, returning scored matches with character-level indices for popup highlighting. For an autocomplete tool running on every keystroke, this keeps ranking well under 1ms for 10,000 candidates.

### Synchronized Output (DECSET 2026)

Modern terminals support DECSET 2026 — the terminal buffers all output between begin/end markers and renders it atomically. This eliminates flicker during popup rendering. Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, and Rio all support this.

For terminals that don't (iTerm2, Terminal.app), we fall back to a pre-render buffer strategy: build the entire frame into a byte buffer and emit it in a single `write()` syscall, relying on kernel write atomicity.

### Terminal Capability Profiling

The `terminal` crate detects the terminal at startup and assigns capabilities via a `TerminalProfile`:

- **RenderStrategy** — `Synchronized` (DECSET 2026) or `PreRenderBuffer` (single write)
- **PromptDetection** — `Osc133` (native) or `ShellIntegration` (OSC 7771 markers)

Detection uses `TERM_PROGRAM` plus terminal-specific env vars (`KITTY_WINDOW_ID`, `WEZTERM_UNIX_SOCKET`, `ALACRITTY_SOCKET`, `ZED_TERM`, `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK_CLI`). Inside tmux, these env vars leak through from the outer terminal, allowing detection of the host terminal.

The overlay and parser crates are strategy-driven — they query the profile for capabilities rather than checking terminal names. Adding a new terminal means adding one enum variant and one match arm in `terminal`; no other crate needs changes.

## Proxy Task Architecture

The PTY proxy runs four concurrent worker tasks plus a main coordination loop:

| Task | Spawn type | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Task A** (stdin reader) | `spawn_blocking` | Reads user keystrokes, intercepts popup navigation when visible, forwards to shell PTY |
| **Task B** (PTY reader) | `spawn_blocking` | Reads shell output, runs VT parser, detects triggers, renders popup, forwards to stdout |
| **Task C** (debounce timer) | `tokio::spawn` (only when `delay_ms > 0`) | Waits for typing pauses, fires delayed suggestion triggers |
| **Task D** (merge loop) | `tokio::spawn` | Drains async provider results from an `mpsc` channel and merges them into the visible popup |
| **Main loop** | `tokio::select!` | Waits on `SIGWINCH`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`, child exit, and the shutdown channel |

Task B notifies Task C via `tokio::sync::Notify` when the buffer is dirty but no immediate trigger fired. Task C resets its timer on each notification and fires a trigger after `delay_ms` (default 150ms) of inactivity. Task D consumes results posted by per-provider tasks so async output can land in an idle shell without waiting for the next keystroke.

## Popup Rendering

The popup is rendered entirely via ANSI escape sequences — no alternate screen buffer, no TUI framework. The rendering flow:

1. Calculate viewport deficit (does the popup fit below the cursor?)
2. If not, scroll the viewport by emitting newlines at the bottom
3. Save cursor (DECSC)
4. For each visible suggestion: position cursor (CUP), apply styling (SGR), write text
5. Restore cursor (DECRC)

All of this is wrapped in DECSET 2026 begin/end markers (or pre-rendered into a single buffer for terminals without synchronized output).

**Scrollback protection**: The popup area is cleared by overwriting with spaces, never by using ED (Erase Display) or EL (Erase Line) — those would push popup text into scrollback history.

## Performance

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Keystroke to suggestion | <50ms | <20ms typical |
| PTY forwarding overhead | <1ms | <1ms |
| Fuzzy match (10k candidates) | <1ms | <1ms (frizbee) |
| Memory (idle) | <10MB | ~8MB |
| Startup | <100ms | <50ms |

Benchmarks use Criterion and live in `suggest` and `parser`. Run with `cargo bench`.

## Shell Integration

Shell integration scripts in `shell/` emit semantic prompt markers:

- **OSC 133** — standard semantic prompt protocol (supported by Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, Rio)
- **OSC 7771** — Termcmp's own marker (used as fallback on Alacritty, iTerm2, Terminal.app)
- **OSC 7773** — Termcmp's exported environment snapshot, consumed by the proxy and stripped before terminal output

Prompt markers are emitted simultaneously by the integration scripts, so the parser can use whichever the terminal supports.

Without shell integration, features are limited — prompt boundary detection falls back to heuristics, and manual trigger (Ctrl+/) is the only way to invoke completions.

### Buffer Reporting (OSC 7772)

The shell integration reports the live edit buffer to the proxy after every
ZLE redraw via OSC 7772:

```
\e]7772;<cursor>;<percent-encoded-utf8-buffer>\a
```

- **`<cursor>`** is a decimal codepoint count (zsh `$CURSOR`).
- **`<percent-encoded-utf8-buffer>`** uses a deliberately small allow-list:
  bytes in `[A-Za-z0-9._~/-]` and the literal space pass through; every
  other byte (including `;`, `\a` (BEL), `\x1b` (ESC), `\\`, `%`, all
  `<0x20` controls, `0x7F`, and `0x80`–`0xFF`) is encoded as `%XX`.
  UTF-8 multibyte sequences are encoded byte-by-byte.

The narrow alphabet is non-negotiable: any unencoded `;` would split the
OSC parameter list and silently truncate the buffer at the parser; any
unencoded BEL would terminate the envelope mid-payload; an unencoded ESC
could smuggle a nested escape sequence into the parser's state machine.
See [ADR 0003](adr/0003-osc7772-buffer-framing.md).

OSC 7770 (the prior raw framing) is accepted by the parser as a deprecated
read-only path for one release: the first hit per process logs a one-shot
`tracing::warn!` and subsequent hits drop to `trace!`. The 7770 dispatch
arm is scheduled for `#[ignore]` in v0.11.0 and removal in v0.12.0. New
shell integrations only emit 7772.

### Environment Reporting (OSC 7773)

The zsh integration reports exported scalar parameters at each prompt via
OSC 7773. The payload is a single percent-encoded field containing
NUL-separated `KEY=value` entries:

```
\e]7773;<percent-encoded-env-snapshot>\a
```

The PTY proxy consumes the frame, stores the snapshot on parser state, and
filters the frame out of the byte stream before writing shell output to the
terminal. Providers use this live snapshot instead of the proxy process's
startup environment, so `export
AWS_PROFILE=...` or other session-level env changes affect completions on
the next prompt.
